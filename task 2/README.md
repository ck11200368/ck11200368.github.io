# Pure CSS Stack

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/finnhvman/pen/xJRMJp](https://codepen.io/finnhvman/pen/xJRMJp).

This is a CSS only game heavily inspired by Ketchapp's Stack (Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stack, iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/hu/app/stack/id1080487957). The goal is to build the highest stack possible, with the maximum of 50. I had to use suboptimal solutions for the animations to make it work without JavaScript, so expect high CPU loads. Works best in Chrome, it's playable in Safari, and janky in Firefox.
